Docker has introduced "Docker Secrets Manager" to avoid baking secrets into Docker images or keeping it in plain text.
To keep it simple this "Secret Manager" use encrypted secrets placed on server. So basically developers should provide keys and Docker will manage them.
There is only one requirement for that and its using Docker Swarm instead of Docker Compose.
